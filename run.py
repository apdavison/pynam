# The "run.py" script is the main script of PyNAM. It can operate in two
# different modes:
#
#   * The "experiment mode". In this case the name of the PyNN backend is passed
#     as a single parameter. A configuration file will be read from the
#     "config.json" file. Optionally, the name of the configuration file can
#     be passed as a second parameter. The experiment is splitted into a list
#     of simulations that can run concurrently. Writes the results to a Matlab
#     file "result.mat"
#
#     Examples:
#         ./run.py nest
#         ./run.py nest experiment.json experiment.mat
#
#   * The "simulation mode". Performs a single simulation run. Reads the
#     simulation parameters from stdin, writes the result to stdout. Both stdin
#     and stdout are in JSON format. Simulation mode is activated by passing the
#     single "--simulation" parameter.
#
#     Examples:
#         cat config.json | ./run.py --simulation > result.json
