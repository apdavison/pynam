PyNAM
======

PyNAM is a spiking neural network implementation of the Willshaw associative memory (BiNAM), implemented in Python with PyNNLess/PyNN as a backend.

It serves as a potential benchmark for neuromorphic hardware systems and as a test bed for experiments with the Willshaw associative memory.

## Usage

To run the complete analysis pipeline, run the program in one of the following
forms:

    ./run.py <SIMULATOR> [<EXPERIMENT>]
    ./run.py <SIMULATOR> --process <EXPERIMENT>

Where `<SIMULATOR>` is the simulator that should be used for execution
and `<EXPERIMENT>` is a JSON file describing the experiment that should be executed.
If `<EXPERIMENT>` is not given, the program will try to execute "experiment.json".

In order to just generate the network descriptions for a specific experiment,
use the following format:

    ./run.py <SIMULATOR> --create <EXPERIMENT>

Note that the `<SIMULATOR>` is needed in order to partition the experiment
according to the hardware resources. This command will generate a set of
".in.gz" files that can be passed to the execution stage:

    ./run.py <SIMULATOR> --exec <IN_1> ... <IN_N>

This command will execute the network simulations for the given network
descriptors -- if more than one network descriptor is given, a new process
will be spawned for each execution. Generates a series of ".out.gz" files
in the same directory as the input files.

    ./run.py <TARGET> --analyse <OUT_1> ... <OUT_N>

Analyses the given output files, generates a HDF5/Matlab file as `<TARGET>`
containing the processed results.

## Simulators

Possible simulators are:

* `spikey`
* `nest`
* `nmmc1`
* `nmpm1`
* `ess`

## Experiment description documentation

The experiment description is read from a JSON-like file format -- in contrast to standard JSON, we allow JavaScript-comments inside the file. The available parameters are as follows:

```javascript
{
    /*
     * The data parameters specify the data that is stored in the Willshaw
     * associative memory and implicitly the network size.
     */
    "data": {
        "n_bits_in": 16, // Number of input bits
        "n_bits_out": 16, // Corresponds to the number of neurons
        "n_ones_in": 3, // Number of ones in the input samples
        "n_ones_out": 3 // Number of ones in the output samples
        //"n_samples": 100 // Number of samples (set automatically if not given)
    },

        "w": 0.011,  // Synapse weight
        "sigma_w": 0.0 // Standard deviation of the synapse weight
    },
