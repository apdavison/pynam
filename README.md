PyNAM
======

PyNAM is a spiking neural network implementation of the Willshaw associative memory (BiNAM), implemented in Python with PyNNLess/PyNN as a backend.

It serves as a potential benchmark for neuromorphic hardware systems and as a test bed for experiments with the Willshaw associative memory.

**Note**: This code is currently work in progress. It misses the implementation of parameter sweeps.
